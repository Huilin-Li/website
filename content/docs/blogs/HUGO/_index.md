# Your personal website 

The important reason of why I build this personal website is I want to share my experiences of learning and practicing knowledge and skills. I hope these experiences could help people and save their time a litte bit. Most importantly, this is a great place to share and record solutions to some annoying troubles. ðŸ™Œ

At this moment, I use **Hugo** +  **Github** to build and matintain my personal website. Therefore, you will see how I build and add new features in this website under the framework of **Hugo**, how I solve troubles, what references I refer, and so on.
