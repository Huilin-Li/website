## Prerequisites
1. Git
2. Windows 10
3. VScode
4. Github account


## Install Hugo
1. In Windows10, right click **Windows Powershell** and click **run as administrator**.
2. Refer to [How to install chocolatey in Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5WLKu_J_AE) to **install chocolatey**.
3. Refer to [Install Hugo on Windows](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/) to **install Hugo** by 
```
choco install hugo-extended
```
4. Make sure Hugo works well by
```
hugo version
```
and we will get the following
```
hugo v0.123.7-312735366b20d64bd61bff8627f593749f86c964+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-03-01T16:16:06Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```


## Create the website using Hugo themes
For example, I want to locally work on my website in `C:\myweb` folder. Still in **Windows Powershell**, 
1. Navigate back to `C:` driver, and create a new folder by typing `mkdir myweb`.
2. Create the website by 
```
hugo new site Blogs
```
3. `cd Blogs` 
4. `git init` 
5. Refer to [Hugo Book Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) to use hugo-book theme by
```
git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/hugo-book
```
6. Till now, if we run `hugo server`, we will get a plain website locally.

In **VS code**, open `Blogs` folder.

7. In `C:/myweb/Blogs/themes/hugo-book/exampleSite/content.en/`, copy `docs` folder, `posts` folder and `_index.md` file to `C:/myweb/Blogs/content/`.
> Why I don't copy the `menu` folder?\
> Because I found `menu` folder doesn't work when I modified the website as I needed.
> We can customize the order of menus in leftbar by adding weight in the `name.md` file. For example, in each `name.md` file, the parameter `weight` determine the order of menues.
> ```
> ---
> weight: 1
> title: One name.md file
> ---
> ```

8. Run `hugo server` again, we will see a more well-done website.

## Deploy on Github by Action
1. Create a **public** Github repository.
> For example, if this repository's name is **Blogs**, your website link will be like this *https://huilin-li.github.io/Blogs/*
2. Still in **Windows Powershell**, push your local work to this repository by
```
cd C:/myweb/Blogs
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Huilin-Li/Blogs.git
git push -u origin main
```
3. Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose **Settings** > **Pages**. In the center of your screen you will see this:

{{< figure src="../images/deploy1.png" width="400" alt="deploy1" >}}

4. Change the Source to `GitHub Actions`.
5. Click `Configure` as the highlight in this picture:

{{< figure src="../images/deploy2.png" width="400" alt="deploy2" >}}


6. Go to [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), copy the `yaml` file in `step 6` to `Blogs/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml`, and commit changes.
7. As **Step8**, **Step9**, **Step10** in [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), the deloyment is done. üéâ

## Update website
Add more contents in `C:/myweb/Blogs/content/` folder, and then `git push` to Github repository. `Github Action` will automaticaly update new contents in `https://huilin-li.github.io/Blogs/`.
