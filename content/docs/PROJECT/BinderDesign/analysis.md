- scaffold-based binder design performs much better than de novo binder design
- 

## Experiments I tried

| Argument | Observation | Star |
| :---         | :---      | :--- |
| complete target protein + given scaffolds  | designed binders are motsly limited to 3-helix prorein|     |
|     |       |       |

- complete target protein + given scaffolds (10,000)
