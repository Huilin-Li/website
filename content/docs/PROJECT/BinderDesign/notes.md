1. **RFdiffusion** is better at designing binders for target proteins that are already existing or have been verified by experiments. If the target protein is predcited by AI models, and has not been verified by experiments, the probability of designing a potential binder for this target will be reduced.
2. The number of designed binders should be huge, in order to pick potential candidates as many as possible.
