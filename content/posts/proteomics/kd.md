\(K_{D}\):the equilibrium dissociation constant. \(K_{D}\) and affinity are inversely related. 
\[
K_{D}=\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}   
\]
\(K_{D}\) value relates to the concentration of ligand (the amount of ligand needed for a particular experiment) and so the lower \(K_{D}\) value (lower concentration) and thus the higher the affinity of the ligand.
