      <description>When I am working on my binder design task, I need to select suitable hotspot residues that can lead to design better binders. In addition to hydrophobic amino acids, I also want to focus on the amino acids whose positions are close to the outside edge, and far away from the center of the protein. Therefore, I expect a plane that can approximately cut the protein layer by layer with my expected distance to the outside edge.</description>
