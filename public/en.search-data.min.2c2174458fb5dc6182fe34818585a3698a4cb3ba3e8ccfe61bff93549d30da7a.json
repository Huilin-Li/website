Everything is step by step.\nPrerequisites\r#\rGit Windows 10 VScode Github account Install Hugo\r#\rIn Windows10, right click Windows Powershell and click run as administrator. Refer to How to install chocolatey in Windows to install chocolatey. Refer to Install Hugo on Windows to install Hugo by choco install hugo-extended Make sure Hugo works well by hugo version and we will get the following\nhugo v0.123.7-312735366b20d64bd61bff8627f593749f86c964+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-03-01T16:16:06Z VendorInfo=gohugoio Create the website using Hugo themes\r#\rFor example, I want to locally work on my website in C:\\myweb folder. Still in Windows Powershell,\nNavigate back to C: driver, and create a new folder by typing mkdir myweb. Create the website by hugo new site Blogs cd Blogs git init Refer to Hugo Book Theme to use hugo-book theme by git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/hugo-book Till now, if we run hugo server, we will get a plain website locally. In VS code, open Blogs folder.\nIn C:/myweb/Blogs/themes/hugo-book/exampleSite/content.en/, copy docs folder, posts folder and _index.md file to C:/myweb/Blogs/content/. Why I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the menu folder?\nBecause I found menu folder doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when I modified the website as I needed. We can customize the order of menus in leftbar by adding weight in the name.md file. For example, in each name.md file, the parameter weight determine the order of menues.\n---\rweight: 1\rtitle: One name.md file\r--- Run hugo server again, we will see a more well-done website. Deploy on Github by Action\r#\rCreate a public Github repository. For example, if this repository\u0026rsquo;s name is Blogs, your website link will be like this https://huilin-li.github.io/Blogs/\nStill in Windows Powershell, push your local work to this repository by cd C:/myweb/Blogs\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \u0026#34;update\u0026#34;\rgit branch -M main\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/Huilin-Li/Blogs.git\rgit push -u origin main Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose Settings \u0026gt; Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this: Change the Source to GitHub Actions. Click Configure as the highlight in this picture: Go to Host on GitHub Pages, copy the yaml file in step 6 to Blogs/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml, and commit changes. As Step8, Step9, Step10 in Host on GitHub Pages, the deloyment is done. üéâ Update website\r#\rAdd more contents in C:/myweb/Blogs/content/ folder, and then git push to Github repository. Github Action will automaticaly update new contents in https://huilin-li.github.io/Blogs/.\nReferences\r#\rHow to install chocolatey in Windows Hugo with Git Hub Pages on Windows Using GitHub Pages with Actions to deploy Hugo sites in seconds - Tommy Byrd // HugoConf 2022 Hugo Book Theme Host on GitHub Pages „ÄêHugo„Äëhugo-book‰∏ªÈ¢ò‰ΩøÁî® Thanks!\r#\rReally appreciate your time for reading my blog, and bless you enjoy your day!
