      <description>target.pdb preprocessing&#xD;#&#xD;Assuming we have a target protein target.pdb, and we want to create a binder to target.pdb. The first step is preprocessing target.pdb. Generally spearking, there are two steps we need to think of.&#xA;Truncating target.pdb&#xD;#&#xD;Truncating target protein helps a lot in reducing the stress of computing. For example, we could remove AAs with very low pLDDT or AAs who are far away from the place we want binders to bind with.</description>

      <description>In my use case, firstly, I tried to de novo design binders. However, I found that designed binders are limited to proteins with only one helix. Then, I changed to design binders based on scaffolds. The design process and scripts I used a lot are as follows.&#xA;Three needed designing environments&#xD;#&#xD;Thanks a lot to the great work, RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN-FastRelax, as well as AlphaFold2, who give us great ways to design proteins.</description>
