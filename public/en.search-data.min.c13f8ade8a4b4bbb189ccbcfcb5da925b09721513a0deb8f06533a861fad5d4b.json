In VS code, open Blogs folder.\nIn C:/myweb/Blogs/themes/hugo-book/exampleSite/content.en/, copy docs folder, posts folder and _index.md file to C:/myweb/Blogs/content/. Why I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the menu folder?\nBecause I found menu folder doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when I modified the website as I needed. We can customize the order of menus in leftbar by adding weight in the name.md file. For example, in each name.md file, the parameter weight determine the order of menues.\n---\rweight: 1\rtitle: One name.md file\r--- Run hugo server again, we will see a more well-done website.

From the main menu choose Settings \u0026gt; Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this: Change the Source to GitHub Actions. Click Configure as the highlight in this picture: Go to Host on GitHub Pages, copy the yaml file in step 6 to Blogs/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml, and commit changes.
