Because Hugo system sees hugo.md as a foler too. However, Hugo system sees _index.md as a file! Therefore, If we want to insert iamges in _index.md file, the command will be like:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;./images/Nice.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;400\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Center the image?\n\u0026lt;center\u0026gt;{ {\u0026lt;figure src=\u0026#34;../images/Nice.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;400\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026gt;} }\u0026lt;/center\u0026gt; At the same time, in hugo.toml, add\n[markup]\r[markup.goldmark]\r[markup.goldmark.renderer]\runsafe = true How to add emoji?\r#\rDirectly copy emoji icon üëã and paste to .md file, instead of using :wave:.\nEmoji Cheat Sheet: https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md\nHow to add a travel map in Hugo?\r#\rRefer to this article\nNOTE:\nIn {{\u0026lt; openstreetmap mapName=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;your map name\u0026gt;\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}, the \u0026lt;your map name\u0026gt; is not the name you give to your map, but the name in the website link of your map. For example, I created a map whose name is Travel, I need to use travel_1036974 in the hugo shortcode.

Create the website by hugo new site Blogs cd Blogs git init Refer to Hugo Book Theme to use hugo-book theme by git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/hugo-book Till now, if we run hugo server, we will get a plain website locally. In VS code, open Blogs folder.\nIn C:/myweb/Blogs/themes/hugo-book/exampleSite/content.en/, copy docs folder, posts folder and _index.md file to C:/myweb/Blogs/content/. Why I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the menu folder?\nBecause I found menu folder doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when I modified the website as I needed. We can customize the order of menus in leftbar by adding weight in the name.md file. For example, in each name.md file, the parameter weight determine the order of menues.\n---\rweight: 1\rtitle: One name.md file\r--- Run hugo server again, we will see a more well-done website. Deploy on Github by Action\r#\rCreate a public Github repository. For example, if this repository\u0026rsquo;s name is Blogs, your website link will be like this https://huilin-li.github.io/Blogs/\nStill in Windows Powershell, push your local work to this repository by cd C:/myweb/Blogs\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \u0026#34;update\u0026#34;\rgit branch -M main\rgit remote add origin https://github.com/Huilin-Li/Blogs.git\rgit push -u origin main Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose Settings \u0026gt; Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this: Change the Source to GitHub Actions. Click Configure as the highlight in this picture: Go to Host on GitHub Pages, copy the yaml file in step 6 to Blogs/.github/workflows/hugo.yaml, and commit changes. As Step8, Step9, Step10 in Host on GitHub Pages, the deloyment is done. üéâ Update website\r#\rAdd more contents in C:/myweb/Blogs/content/ folder, and then git push to Github repository.
